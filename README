About:
======

rsvpd is a simple daemonised ping script, created by RightShift, as part of a solution to graph and research possible
issues between nodes. It reads servers to monitor from a server list file, and continuously logs the output of the
pings (min, max, avg, packetloss) to a statsd server.

For simplicity, we have combined several scripts (originally our 'bin' and init.d) into a single rsvpd.sh.

Notes On Usage:
===============

Make sure that wherever rsvpd.sh lives, a link to it exists in /etc/init.d/ and that the rsvpd.conf is readable.

Secondly, copy the rsvpd.conf to /etc/rsvpd.conf, add a list of hosts to [HOSTS] which you wish to monitor.
Lastly, edit STATSDHOST (under [CONFIGS]) to refer to your statsd instance.
The script can then be started and stopped like any other service.
